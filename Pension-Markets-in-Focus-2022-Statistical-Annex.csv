"Note: The total amount of investments of funded and private pension plans is taken as a proxy of the total amount of assets in these plans. (1) Data refer to Pensionskassen only. (2) Data cover pension funds, pension insurance contracts (since 2005) and individual pension savings (since 2017). Net technical provisions are taken as a proxy of assets in pension insurance contracts. (3) The method used to estimate the assets of trusteed pension funds changed in 2021 following the redesign of a quarterly survey used for data collection. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) The break in series in 2011 comes from the exclusion of public buffer funds, included before. (6) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (7) The drop of assets in 2011 comes from a pension reform that suspended payments to mandatory individual schemes and redirected all the contributions to pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, unless workers chose to keep these individual pension schemes by the end of January 2011. The break in series in 2016 is due to the inclusion of individual retirement accounts (available through banks and investment companies) and pension insurance products, not included before. (8) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. (9) Data on personal retirement savings accounts are included from 2014 onwards. The decrease in DC assets for Ireland in 2016 arose from a change in methodology (previously estimation based on industry reports). Estimates are now based on the aggregation of data submitted on an annual basis to the pensions supervisor by individual DC schemes. (10) Data include book reserves, with net technical provisions taken as a proxy of pension assets. (11) The amount in 2019 is an OECD estimate, with the amount of assets in personal plans estimated based on 2018 and 2020 data. (12) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (14) Data refer to pension funds only. (15) The drop in investments in 2014 is due to the reversal of the mandatory private pension system that led to a transfer of domestic sovereign bonds held by open pension funds into the social security system. (16) The drop of assets in 2011 is the result of the transfer of bank pension funds (i.e. pension funds sponsored by banks and having as beneficiaries the employees of their banks) to the Public Retirement System. Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (17) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (18) Data cover occupational plans, and personal plans from 2013 onwards. Data on personal plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (19) Data refer to personal plans only. (20) Data refer to gross assets of pension funds (excluding derivatives). (21) The break in series in 2011 is due to a change in legislation, withdrawals and the unavailability of data from one of the three funds that was operating under the old framework. (22) A pension reform led to the transfer of pension fund assets to the National Social Security Administration. (23) The break in series in 2014 is due to the inclusion of open entities (under the supervision of SUSEP), not included before. (24) Data refer to enterprise annuities. (25) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (26) Data include occupational plans from 2014 onwards. (27) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (28) Data refer to the net asset value of private retirement schemes (PRS) and can be retrieved in the annual reports of the Securities Commission Malaysia. (29) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (30) Data cover all the accounts of the CPF, which may not all be earmarked for retirement purposes (e.g. the Medisave account). (31) Data refer to the amount of assets of all funds (including those not supervised under the Pension Funds Act such as the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) established by separate statutes). Data can be retrieved on the FSCA website (annual reports). (32) Data refer to occupational plans only, and do not cover the NSSA nor the Government Pension Scheme.

"Note: The total amount of investments of funded and private pension plans is taken as a proxy of the total amount of assets in these plans. (1) Data refer to Pensionskassen only. (2) Data cover pension funds, pension insurance contracts (since 2005) and individual pension savings (since 2017). Net technical provisions are taken as a proxy of assets in pension insurance contracts. (3) The method used to estimate the assets of trusteed pension funds changed in 2021 following the redesign of a quarterly survey used for data collection. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) The break in series in 2011 comes from the exclusion of public buffer funds, included before. (6) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (7) The drop of assets in 2011 comes from a pension reform that suspended payments to mandatory individual schemes and redirected all the contributions to pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, unless workers chose to keep these individual pension schemes by the end of January 2011. The break in series in 2016 is due to the inclusion of individual retirement accounts (available through banks and investment companies) and pension insurance products, not included before. (8) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. (9) Data on personal retirement savings accounts are included from 2014 onwards. The decrease in DC assets for Ireland in 2016 arose from a change in methodology (previously estimation based on industry reports). Estimates are now based on the aggregation of data submitted on an annual basis to the pensions supervisor by individual DC schemes. (10) Data include book reserves, with net technical provisions taken as a proxy of pension assets. (11) The amount in 2019 is an OECD estimate, with the amount of assets in personal plans estimated based on 2018 and 2020 data. (12) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (14) Data refer to pension funds only. (15) The drop in investments in 2014 is due to the reversal of the mandatory private pension system that led to a transfer of domestic sovereign bonds held by open pension funds into the social security system. (16) The drop of assets in 2011 is the result of the transfer of bank pension funds (i.e. pension funds sponsored by banks and having as beneficiaries the employees of their banks) to the Public Retirement System. Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (17) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (18) Data cover occupational plans, and personal plans from 2013 onwards. Data on personal plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (19) Data refer to personal plans only. (20) Data refer to gross assets of pension funds (excluding derivatives). (21) The break in series in 2011 is due to a change in legislation, withdrawals and the unavailability of data from one of the three funds that was operating under the old framework. (22) A pension reform led to the transfer of pension fund assets to the National Social Security Administration. (23) The break in series in 2014 is due to the inclusion of open entities (under the supervision of SUSEP), not included before. (24) Data refer to enterprise annuities. (25) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (26) Data include occupational plans from 2014 onwards. (27) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (28) Data refer to the net asset value of private retirement schemes (PRS) and can be retrieved in the annual reports of the Securities Commission Malaysia. (29) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (30) Data cover all the accounts of the CPF, which may not all be earmarked for retirement purposes (e.g. the Medisave account). (31) Data refer to the amount of assets of all funds (including those not supervised under the Pension Funds Act such as the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) established by separate statutes). Data can be retrieved on the FSCA website (annual reports). (32) Data refer to occupational plans only, and do not cover the NSSA nor the Government Pension Scheme. (33) Totals in a given year are calculated on all the jurisdictions for which a value is available. The number of jurisdictions that the totals include may therefore vary over the years.

"Note: The total amount of investments of funded and private pension plans is taken as a proxy of the total amount of assets in these plans. (1) Data refer to Pensionskassen only. (2) Data cover pension funds, pension insurance contracts (since 2005) and individual pension savings (since 2017). Net technical provisions are taken as a proxy of assets in pension insurance contracts. (3) The method used to estimate the assets of trusteed pension funds changed in 2021 following the redesign of a quarterly survey used for data collection. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) The break in series in 2011 comes from the exclusion of public buffer funds, included before. (6) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (7) The drop of assets in 2011 comes from a pension reform that suspended payments to mandatory individual schemes and redirected all the contributions to pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, unless workers chose to keep these individual pension schemes by the end of January 2011. The break in series in 2016 is due to the inclusion of individual retirement accounts (available through banks and investment companies) and pension insurance products, not included before. (8) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. (9) Data on personal retirement savings accounts are included from 2014 onwards. The decrease in DC assets for Ireland in 2016 arose from a change in methodology (previously estimation based on industry reports). Estimates are now based on the aggregation of data submitted on an annual basis to the pensions supervisor by individual DC schemes. (10) Data include book reserves, with net technical provisions taken as a proxy of pension assets. (11) The amount in 2019 is an OECD estimate, with the amount of assets in personal plans estimated based on 2018 and 2020 data. (12) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (14) Data refer to pension funds only. (15) The drop in investments in 2014 is due to the reversal of the mandatory private pension system that led to a transfer of domestic sovereign bonds held by open pension funds into the social security system. (16) The drop of assets in 2011 is the result of the transfer of bank pension funds (i.e. pension funds sponsored by banks and having as beneficiaries the employees of their banks) to the Public Retirement System. Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (17) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (18) Data cover occupational plans, and personal plans from 2013 onwards. Data on personal plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (19) Data refer to personal plans only. (20) Data refer to gross assets of pension funds (excluding derivatives). (21) The break in series in 2011 is due to a change in legislation, withdrawals and the unavailability of data from one of the three funds that was operating under the old framework. (22) A pension reform led to the transfer of pension fund assets to the National Social Security Administration. (23) The break in series in 2014 is due to the inclusion of open entities (under the supervision of SUSEP), not included before. (24) Data refer to enterprise annuities. (25) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (26) Data include occupational plans from 2014 onwards. (27) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (28) Data refer to the net asset value of private retirement schemes (PRS) and can be retrieved in the annual reports of the Securities Commission Malaysia. (29) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (30) Data cover all the accounts of the CPF, which may not all be earmarked for retirement purposes (e.g. the Medisave account). (31) Data refer to the amount of assets of all funds (including those not supervised under the Pension Funds Act such as the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) established by separate statutes). Data can be retrieved on the FSCA website (annual reports). (32) Data refer to occupational plans only, and do not cover the NSSA nor the Government Pension Scheme.

"Note: (1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. (3) Data refer to trusteed pension funds only. Source: Statistics Canada (Table:11-10-0079-01). (4) Data refer to contributions paid to AFPs only. (5) Data include personal plans, occupational plans and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers). (6) Source: CNB ARAD database. Data include employer, employee and state contributions. (7) Data refer to contributions paid to pension funds and pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. From mid-2009 to 2011, the State temporarily suspended contributions to these plans. (9) Source: DREES. There is a change in the calculation method of contributions from 2018. (10) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (11) Data refer to contributions paid into pension funds only. The drop in the contributions in 2011 comes from a pension reform which suspended payments to the mandatory funded individual schemes and redirected all the contributions to pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, unless workers chose to keep these individual schemes by the end of January 2011. (12) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. Contributions paid to pension insurance contracts are OECD estimates for 2017 and 2018. In 2017, the municipalities and the government made an extra contribution to the pension fund of civil servants which was converted from DB to DC. (13) Data on pre-existing non-autonomous pension funds (i.e. created before the reform in 1993) are included from 2005 onwards. (14) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (15) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (16) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (17) Data refer to employer, employee and state contributions to KiwiSaver plans for each financial year. (18) The decline in contributions in 2012 is likely due to a reduction of the contribution rate to open pension funds from 7.3% to 3.5% of salary following an amendment of the pension law in May 2011. Participation in the funded pension system became voluntary in 2014. Since 2019, workers are gradually automatically enrolled in a pension plan, with the possibility to opt out. (19) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (20) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years.  The decline in contributions between 2012 and 2013 is due to a change in the contribution rates (from 9% to 4% of salary). (21) Data refer to contributions paid to pension funds and book reserves. (22) Data refer to personal plans only. (23) Data refer to contributions paid into occupational plans and IRAs. (24)  Data refer to contributions paid to closed pension funds only. (25) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (26) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (27) Data refer to the National Pension Scheme only. (28) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (29) Source: FSCA Annual Reports. Data cover all retirement funds in South Africa.

"Note: Benefits refer to the sum of lump sum and pensions paid from retirement savings plans in a given year. (1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. (3) Data refer to pension payments and cash withdrawals from trusteed pension funds. Source: Statistics Canada (Table:11-10-0079-01). (4) Data include personal plans, occupational plans and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers). (5) Data refer to benefits paid by pension funds and pension insurance contracts only. (6)  Data refer to benefits paid by the second pension pillar only. (7) Source: DREES. There is a change in the calculation method of benefits from 2018. (8) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (9) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. Benefits paid from pension insurance contracts are OECD estimates for 2017 and 2018. (10) Data only refer to benefits paid by pension funds and from book reserves (included from 2005 onwards). (11) Data refer to benefits paid from (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (12) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) Data refer to benefits paid by pension funds and from book reserves only. (16) Data refer to personal plans only. (17) Data refer to benefits paid from occupational plans and IRAs. (18) Benefits include payments to heirs and dependants. (19) Data refer to benefits paid by closed pension funds only. (20) Data refer to benefit payments by pension insurance companies only. (21) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (22) Data refer to MPF schemes only. (23) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (24) Data refer to benefits paid by AFPs only. (25) Source: FSCA Annual Reports. Data cover pensions and lump sum payments (on retirement or death) by all retirement funds in South Africa.

"Note:  Data have been calculated using a common formula for the average nominal net investment return (ratio between the net investment income at the end of the year and the average level of assets during the year) for all the jurisdictions except for: Austria (2011-2012), Finland (2015), France, Ireland, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands (2021), Sweden (2011-2018), Türkiye (2011, 2013-2014, 2016-2017) among OECD countries; and Angola, Armenia, Botswana (2017), Georgia (2019), Ghana (2014-2016), Hong Kong (China), India (2011, 2013-2014), Kazakhstan (2018), Kenya (2011), Macau (China) (2019), Malawi (2013), Maldives, Malta (2011), Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia (2016), Papua New Guinea (2017), Romania (2010), Russia (2013), Suriname (2016), Tanzania (2015), Trinidad and Tobago (2019), Uganda, Ukraine (2010, 2017-2018), and Zambia for which values have been provided by the jurisdictions or are from national official publications. Data for Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica (before 2008), the Dominican Republic (before 2018 and for 2021), El Salvador, Panama and Uruguay (before 2016) are from AIOS. Investment returns for the United States have been calculated based on data available on the FRB website. Investment returns for a given year N are calculated over the period end-December of year N-1 and end-December of year N for all jurisdictions, except: Australia (over end-June N-1 and end-June N); Japan and New Zealand (over end-March N-1 and end-March N). Investment returns are net of investment expenses. Pension authorities may produce their own estimates of annual investment returns that may differ from OECD estimates (due to different methodologies or scopes for instance), such as in the case of Lithuania and Türkiye.

"Note: The “Other” category includes loans, land and buildings, unallocated insurance contracts, hedge funds, private equity funds, structured products, other mutual funds (i.e. not invested in equities, bills and bonds or cash and deposits) and other investments. Negative values (due to derivatives) have been excluded from the calculations of the allocation of pension plan assets. The OECD Global Pension Statistics exercise gathers information on the investments of pension plan assets in collective investment schemes (CIS) and the look-through of these investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other. Data on asset allocation in the Tables include both direct investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and indirect investments through CIS when the look-through of CIS investments is available. In such case, the Tables show the overall exposure of pension plan assets in the selected asset classes. When the look-through is not available, the Tables only show the direct investments of pension plan assets in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other assets; the sum of investments in these four categories is not equal to 100% and the difference to 100% corresponds to the share of pension assets invested in collective investment schemes. There has been a change in the reporting of investments in CIS and the related look-through over the period for Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom among OECD countries; and for Botswana, Brazil, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Thailand and Zambia among non-OECD jurisdictions.

(1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. Data on individual pension savings for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (3) There is a break in series in 2021 due to the redesign of the underlying quarterly survey used for data collection and to the changes in some definitions. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) Data refer to pension funds and pension insurance contracts. (6) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. (7) Data refer to pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data are estimates; the breakdown of investments through CIS has not been approved by external auditors yet and is not available for Pensionsfonds. (9) Data include pension funds, and all other financing vehicles (except pension insurance contracts) from 2010 onwards. (10) Data refer to DB plans only. (11) Source: Bank of Japan. Claims of pension funds on pension managers are excluded from the calculations of the asset allocation of Japan’s pension funds. The high value for the “Other” category in Japan is mainly driven by outward investments in securities. (12) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (16) Data refer to personal plans only. (17) Data for 2019 onwards come from a new ONS survey. (18) Data refer to closed pension funds only. (19) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (20) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (21) Data cover MPF schemes and MPF-exempted ORSO registered schemes only. (22) Data refer to the National Pension Scheme and Atal Pension Yojana. (23) Source: CPF's website. (24) Data refer to pension funds supervised under the Pension Funds Act only.

"Note: The “Other” category includes loans, land and buildings, unallocated insurance contracts, hedge funds, private equity funds, structured products, other mutual funds (i.e. not invested in equities, bills and bonds or cash and deposits) and other investments. Negative values (due to derivatives) have been excluded from the calculations of the allocation of pension plan assets. The OECD Global Pension Statistics exercise gathers information on the investments of pension plan assets in collective investment schemes (CIS) and the look-through of these investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other. Data on asset allocation in the Tables include both direct investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and indirect investments through CIS when the look-through of CIS investments is available. In such case, the Tables show the overall exposure of pension plan assets in the selected asset classes. When the look-through is not available, the Tables only show the direct investments of pension plan assets in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other assets; the sum of investments in these four categories is not equal to 100% and the difference to 100% corresponds to the share of pension assets invested in collective investment schemes. There has been a change in the reporting of investments in CIS and the related look-through over the period for Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom among OECD countries; and for Botswana, Brazil, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Thailand and Zambia among non-OECD jurisdictions.

(1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. Data on individual pension savings for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (3) There is a break in series in 2021 due to the redesign of the underlying quarterly survey used for data collection and to the changes in some definitions. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) Data refer to pension funds and pension insurance contracts. (6) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. (7) Data refer to pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data are estimates; the breakdown of investments through CIS has not been approved by external auditors yet and is not available for Pensionsfonds. (9) Data include pension funds, and all other financing vehicles (except pension insurance contracts) from 2010 onwards. (10) Data refer to DB plans only. (11) Source: Bank of Japan. Claims of pension funds on pension managers are excluded from the calculations of the asset allocation of Japan’s pension funds. The high value for the “Other” category in Japan is mainly driven by outward investments in securities. (12) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (16) Data refer to personal plans only.

"Note: The “Other” category includes loans, land and buildings, unallocated insurance contracts, hedge funds, private equity funds, structured products, other mutual funds (i.e. not invested in equities, bills and bonds or cash and deposits) and other investments. Negative values (due to derivatives) have been excluded from the calculations of the allocation of pension plan assets. The OECD Global Pension Statistics exercise gathers information on the investments of pension plan assets in collective investment schemes (CIS) and the look-through of these investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other. Data on asset allocation in the Tables include both direct investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and indirect investments through CIS when the look-through of CIS investments is available. In such case, the Tables show the overall exposure of pension plan assets in the selected asset classes. When the look-through is not available, the Tables only show the direct investments of pension plan assets in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other assets; the sum of investments in these four categories is not equal to 100% and the difference to 100% corresponds to the share of pension assets invested in collective investment schemes. There has been a change in the reporting of investments in CIS and the related look-through over the period for Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom among OECD countries; and for Botswana, Brazil, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Thailand and Zambia among non-OECD jurisdictions.

(1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. Data on individual pension savings for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (3) There is a break in series in 2021 due to the redesign of the underlying quarterly survey used for data collection and to the changes in some definitions. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) Data refer to pension funds and pension insurance contracts. (6) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. (7) Data refer to pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data are estimates; the breakdown of investments through CIS has not been approved by external auditors yet and is not available for Pensionsfonds. (9) Data include pension funds, and all other financing vehicles (except pension insurance contracts) from 2010 onwards. (10) Data refer to DB plans only. (11) Source: Bank of Japan. Claims of pension funds on pension managers are excluded from the calculations of the asset allocation of Japan’s pension funds. The high value for the “Other” category in Japan is mainly driven by outward investments in securities. (12) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (16) Data refer to personal plans only. (17) Data for 2019 onwards come from a new ONS survey. (18) Data refer to closed pension funds only. (19) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (20) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (21) Data cover MPF schemes and MPF-exempted ORSO registered schemes only. (22) Data refer to the National Pension Scheme and Atal Pension Yojana. (23) Source: CPF's website. (24) Data refer to pension funds supervised under the Pension Funds Act only.

"Note: The “Other” category includes loans, land and buildings, unallocated insurance contracts, hedge funds, private equity funds, structured products, other mutual funds (i.e. not invested in equities, bills and bonds or cash and deposits) and other investments. Negative values (due to derivatives) have been excluded from the calculations of the allocation of pension plan assets. The OECD Global Pension Statistics exercise gathers information on the investments of pension plan assets in collective investment schemes (CIS) and the look-through of these investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other. Data on asset allocation in the Tables include both direct investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and indirect investments through CIS when the look-through of CIS investments is available. In such case, the Tables show the overall exposure of pension plan assets in the selected asset classes. When the look-through is not available, the Tables only show the direct investments of pension plan assets in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other assets; the sum of investments in these four categories is not equal to 100% and the difference to 100% corresponds to the share of pension assets invested in collective investment schemes. There has been a change in the reporting of investments in CIS and the related look-through over the period for Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom among OECD countries; and for Botswana, Brazil, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Thailand and Zambia among non-OECD jurisdictions.

(1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. Data on individual pension savings for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (3) There is a break in series in 2021 due to the redesign of the underlying quarterly survey used for data collection and to the changes in some definitions. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) Data refer to pension funds and pension insurance contracts. (6) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. (7) Data refer to pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data are estimates; the breakdown of investments through CIS has not been approved by external auditors yet and is not available for Pensionsfonds. (9) Data include pension funds, and all other financing vehicles (except pension insurance contracts) from 2010 onwards. (10) Data refer to DB plans only. (11) Source: Bank of Japan. Claims of pension funds on pension managers are excluded from the calculations of the asset allocation of Japan’s pension funds. The high value for the “Other” category in Japan is mainly driven by outward investments in securities. (12) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (16) Data refer to personal plans only. (17) Data for 2019 onwards come from a new ONS survey. (18) Data refer to closed pension funds only. (19) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (20) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (21) Data cover MPF schemes and MPF-exempted ORSO registered schemes only. (22) Data refer to the National Pension Scheme and Atal Pension Yojana. (23) Source: CPF's website. (24) Data refer to pension funds supervised under the Pension Funds Act only.
