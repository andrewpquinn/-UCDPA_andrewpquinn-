"Note: (1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) There is a break in series in 2021 due to the redesign of the underlying quarterly survey used for data collection. (3) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (4) Data refer to ATP and pension insurance contracts. (5) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. (6) Data for pension insurance contracts (and therefore the total for all pension plans) for 2017 and 2018 are OECD estimates. (7) Data exclude investments in unallocated insurance contracts.

Data refer to outward investments in securities: investments by residents in shares and securities issued by non-residents overseas or in Japan. (9) Data refer to personal pension insurance contracts. (10) Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (11) Data refer to open pension funds only. (12) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well.
