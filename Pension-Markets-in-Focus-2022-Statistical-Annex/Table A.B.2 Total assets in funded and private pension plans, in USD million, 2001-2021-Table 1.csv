"Note: The total amount of investments of funded and private pension plans is taken as a proxy of the total amount of assets in these plans. (1) Data refer to Pensionskassen only. (2) Data cover pension funds, pension insurance contracts (since 2005) and individual pension savings (since 2017). Net technical provisions are taken as a proxy of assets in pension insurance contracts. (3) The method used to estimate the assets of trusteed pension funds changed in 2021 following the redesign of a quarterly survey used for data collection. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) The break in series in 2011 comes from the exclusion of public buffer funds, included before. (6) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (7) The drop of assets in 2011 comes from a pension reform that suspended payments to mandatory individual schemes and redirected all the contributions to pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, unless workers chose to keep these individual pension schemes by the end of January 2011. The break in series in 2016 is due to the inclusion of individual retirement accounts (available through banks and investment companies) and pension insurance products, not included before. (8) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. (9) Data on personal retirement savings accounts are included from 2014 onwards. The decrease in DC assets for Ireland in 2016 arose from a change in methodology (previously estimation based on industry reports). Estimates are now based on the aggregation of data submitted on an annual basis to the pensions supervisor by individual DC schemes. (10) Data include book reserves, with net technical provisions taken as a proxy of pension assets. (11) The amount in 2019 is an OECD estimate, with the amount of assets in personal plans estimated based on 2018 and 2020 data. (12) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (14) Data refer to pension funds only. (15) The drop in investments in 2014 is due to the reversal of the mandatory private pension system that led to a transfer of domestic sovereign bonds held by open pension funds into the social security system. (16) The drop of assets in 2011 is the result of the transfer of bank pension funds (i.e. pension funds sponsored by banks and having as beneficiaries the employees of their banks) to the Public Retirement System. Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (17) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (18) Data cover occupational plans, and personal plans from 2013 onwards. Data on personal plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (19) Data refer to personal plans only. (20) Data refer to gross assets of pension funds (excluding derivatives). (21) The break in series in 2011 is due to a change in legislation, withdrawals and the unavailability of data from one of the three funds that was operating under the old framework. (22) A pension reform led to the transfer of pension fund assets to the National Social Security Administration. (23) The break in series in 2014 is due to the inclusion of open entities (under the supervision of SUSEP), not included before. (24) Data refer to enterprise annuities. (25) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (26) Data include occupational plans from 2014 onwards. (27) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (28) Data refer to the net asset value of private retirement schemes (PRS) and can be retrieved in the annual reports of the Securities Commission Malaysia. (29) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (30) Data cover all the accounts of the CPF, which may not all be earmarked for retirement purposes (e.g. the Medisave account). (31) Data refer to the amount of assets of all funds (including those not supervised under the Pension Funds Act such as the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) established by separate statutes). Data can be retrieved on the FSCA website (annual reports). (32) Data refer to occupational plans only, and do not cover the NSSA nor the Government Pension Scheme. (33) Totals in a given year are calculated on all the jurisdictions for which a value is available. The number of jurisdictions that the totals include may therefore vary over the years.
