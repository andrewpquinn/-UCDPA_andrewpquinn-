"Note: Benefits refer to the sum of lump sum and pensions paid from retirement savings plans in a given year. (1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. (3) Data refer to pension payments and cash withdrawals from trusteed pension funds. Source: Statistics Canada (Table:11-10-0079-01). (4) Data include personal plans, occupational plans and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers). (5) Data refer to benefits paid by pension funds and pension insurance contracts only. (6)  Data refer to benefits paid by the second pension pillar only. (7) Source: DREES. There is a change in the calculation method of benefits from 2018. (8) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (9) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. Benefits paid from pension insurance contracts are OECD estimates for 2017 and 2018. (10) Data only refer to benefits paid by pension funds and from book reserves (included from 2005 onwards). (11) Data refer to benefits paid from (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (12) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) Data refer to benefits paid by pension funds and from book reserves only. (16) Data refer to personal plans only. (17) Data refer to benefits paid from occupational plans and IRAs. (18) Benefits include payments to heirs and dependants. (19) Data refer to benefits paid by closed pension funds only. (20) Data refer to benefit payments by pension insurance companies only. (21) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (22) Data refer to MPF schemes only. (23) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (24) Data refer to benefits paid by AFPs only. (25) Source: FSCA Annual Reports. Data cover pensions and lump sum payments (on retirement or death) by all retirement funds in South Africa.
