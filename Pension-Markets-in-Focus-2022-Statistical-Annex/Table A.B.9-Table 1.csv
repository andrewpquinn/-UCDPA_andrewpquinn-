"Note: The “Other” category includes loans, land and buildings, unallocated insurance contracts, hedge funds, private equity funds, structured products, other mutual funds (i.e. not invested in equities, bills and bonds or cash and deposits) and other investments. Negative values (due to derivatives) have been excluded from the calculations of the allocation of pension plan assets. The OECD Global Pension Statistics exercise gathers information on the investments of pension plan assets in collective investment schemes (CIS) and the look-through of these investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other. Data on asset allocation in the Tables include both direct investments in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and indirect investments through CIS when the look-through of CIS investments is available. In such case, the Tables show the overall exposure of pension plan assets in the selected asset classes. When the look-through is not available, the Tables only show the direct investments of pension plan assets in equities, bills and bonds, cash and deposits and other assets; the sum of investments in these four categories is not equal to 100% and the difference to 100% corresponds to the share of pension assets invested in collective investment schemes. There has been a change in the reporting of investments in CIS and the related look-through over the period for Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom among OECD countries; and for Botswana, Brazil, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Suriname, Thailand and Zambia among non-OECD jurisdictions.

(1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. Data on individual pension savings for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (3) There is a break in series in 2021 due to the redesign of the underlying quarterly survey used for data collection and to the changes in some definitions. (4) Data include occupational plans from 2015 onwards, and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers) from 2017 onwards. (5) Data refer to pension funds and pension insurance contracts. (6) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. (7) Data refer to pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data are estimates; the breakdown of investments through CIS has not been approved by external auditors yet and is not available for Pensionsfonds. (9) Data include pension funds, and all other financing vehicles (except pension insurance contracts) from 2010 onwards. (10) Data refer to DB plans only. (11) Source: Bank of Japan. Claims of pension funds on pension managers are excluded from the calculations of the asset allocation of Japan’s pension funds. The high value for the “Other” category in Japan is mainly driven by outward investments in securities. (12) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (13) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead. (14) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (15) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years. (16) Data refer to personal plans only.
