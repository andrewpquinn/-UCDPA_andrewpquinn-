"Note: (1) Data refer to pension funds only. (2) Data cover pension funds, and individual pension savings from 2017 onwards. (3) Data refer to trusteed pension funds only. Source: Statistics Canada (Table:11-10-0079-01). (4) Data refer to contributions paid to AFPs only. (5) Data include personal plans, occupational plans and first pillar pension plans (alternative regime schemes for teachers and judicial workers). (6) Source: CNB ARAD database. Data include employer, employee and state contributions. (7) Data refer to contributions paid to pension funds and pension insurance contracts only. (8) Data refer to the second pension pillar only. From mid-2009 to 2011, the State temporarily suspended contributions to these plans. (9) Source: DREES. There is a change in the calculation method of contributions from 2018. (10) The break in series in 2013 comes from the transformation of four funds operating on a pay-as-you-go basis into funded occupational schemes. (11) Data refer to contributions paid into pension funds only. The drop in the contributions in 2011 comes from a pension reform which suspended payments to the mandatory funded individual schemes and redirected all the contributions to pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, unless workers chose to keep these individual schemes by the end of January 2011. (12) Data on pension insurance contracts are included from 2008 onward. Contributions paid to pension insurance contracts are OECD estimates for 2017 and 2018. In 2017, the municipalities and the government made an extra contribution to the pension fund of civil servants which was converted from DB to DC. (13) Data on pre-existing non-autonomous pension funds (i.e. created before the reform in 1993) are included from 2005 onwards. (14) Data refer to (occupational) retirement pension plans and personal pension insurance contracts. (15) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of pension funds supervised by the CSSF, not included in previous years. (16) The break in series in 2005 is due to the inclusion of occupational pension plans registered by the National Commission for the Retirement Savings System (CONSAR) since 2005, not included in previous years. Data for occupational pension plans for 2021 refer to 2020 instead, as 2021 data were not available at the time of the drafting of this report. (17) Data refer to employer, employee and state contributions to KiwiSaver plans for each financial year. (18) The decline in contributions in 2012 is likely due to a reduction of the contribution rate to open pension funds from 7.3% to 3.5% of salary following an amendment of the pension law in May 2011. Participation in the funded pension system became voluntary in 2014. Since 2019, workers are gradually automatically enrolled in a pension plan, with the possibility to opt out. (19) Data cover closed and open pension funds and personal retirement saving funds (established as pension funds or as collective investment schemes managed by investment companies), and since 2017 personal plans offered by life insurance companies as well. (20) The break in series in 2006 is due to the inclusion of voluntary pension plans, not included in previous years.  The decline in contributions between 2012 and 2013 is due to a change in the contribution rates (from 9% to 4% of salary). (21) Data refer to contributions paid to pension funds and book reserves. (22) Data refer to personal plans only. (23) Data refer to contributions paid into occupational plans and IRAs. (24)  Data refer to contributions paid to closed pension funds only. (25) Data include pension insurance companies from 2018 onwards. (26) Data for one DB pension scheme is missing for 2014, hampering the data comparability with previous years. (27) Data refer to the National Pension Scheme only. (28) Data refer to some occupational voluntary pension schemes only. (29) Source: FSCA Annual Reports. Data cover all retirement funds in South Africa.
